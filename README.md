# Project Summary

This design does have some limitations in its current state, such as no ability to search based on the comments about a sighting. This could be added in the future. Another possible expansion could be a multiple layered filter based on more than one piece of criteria being met (i.e. sightings both over a certain duration of time and comments containing specific words).
